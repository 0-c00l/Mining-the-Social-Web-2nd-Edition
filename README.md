Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition
=================================

The official online compendium for Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly, 2013)

_Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition_ is currently available through O'Reilly Media's Early Access and Rough Cuts programs. The final version of the book will not be complete until the September/October timeframe, but in the meanwhile, you can get the latest source code here and pre-order a copy of the ebook directly from O'Reilly at http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030195.do 

Pre-ordering through O'Reilly's Early Access program contains a number of great benefits including regular updates as the final manuscript of the book is completed as well as continual updates to the book for life! (And for a book that's built on social web APIs, rest assured that API changes will occasionally require the text of the book and examples to be updated.)
