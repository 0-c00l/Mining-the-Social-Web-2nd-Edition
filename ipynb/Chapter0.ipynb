      "\n",
      "Welcome to the source code repository for [_Mining the Social Web (2nd Edition)_](http://bit.ly/135dHfs)! This IPython Notebook provides an interactive way to follow along with and explore the numbered examples from the book, and the intent behind this notebook is to reinforce the concepts from the sample code in a fun, convenient, and effective way.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are reading this page, it probably means that you've been able to either successfully download the virtual machine and point your browser to this IPython Notebook, or it means that you've been able to download the source code and start IPython Notebook on your own without the virtual machine. In either case, let me be the first to offer my congratulations and let you know that I am excited that you've chosen to take an interest in _Mining the Social Web_. (In the somewhat unlikely event that you've somehow stumbled across this notebook outside of its context on GitHub, [you can find the full source code repository here](http://bit.ly/16kGNyb).)\n",
      "\n",
      "The default expectation is that you as a consumer of _Mining the Social Web_ and its source code will take advantage of the virtual machine experience (powered by Vagrant) that's provided with this book. See the README.md file in the parent directory for a brief overview on just how quick and easy Vagrant makes it to get started and so that you can avoid dealing with myriad system administration complexities that you would otherwise be liable for figuring out to configure your development environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The directory that contains this file also contains all of the IPython Notebooks for _Mining the Social Web_, so in order to explore the source code for any given chapter, just open the corresponding notebook from http://localhost:8888. If you haven't previously encountered IPython Notebook, you can learn more about it at http://ipython.org/notebook.html. The source code for _Mining the Social Web_ book uses IPython Notebook almost exclusively to present the source code as a means of streamlining and enhancing the learning experience, so it is highly recommended that you take a few minutes to learn more about how it works and why it's such an excellent learning (and development) platform.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although great care has been taken to try and ensure that you won't have to use a secure shell to login to the virtual machine, there is great value in learning how to use an SSH client to login to a machine and be productive in a terminal session, and there will inevitably be times when you may need to troubleshoot on the virtual machine despite our best efforts. If you are already comfortable using a secure shell, you'll simply type <code>vagrant ssh</code> from the _vagrant_ folder where your _Vagrantfile_ is located, and you'll get automatically logged in if you have an SSH client already installed. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a Mac or Linux user, you will already have an SSH client installed and your remote login should \"just work\", but if you are a Windows user, you will likely not have an SSH client installed unless you're already using a tool like [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) or [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.io/). In any event, if you've used an SSH client before, you'll have no troubles using <code>vagrant ssh</code> to perform a remote login. If you have not used an SSH client before, you won't necessarily need to learn to use one, but it might be in your overall best interest to learn how to use one at your leisure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even without an SSH client, however, there are a couple of creative ways that you can use a Python script and IPython Notebook to give you much of the same functionality that you would achieve by performing a remote login to gain terminal access.

The following script shows how to run a few remote commands  on the virtual machine (where this IPython Notebook server would be running if you are using the virtual machine). Even in situations where you are running a Python program locally, this package can be of significant convenience."

The way it works is that if you write <code>%%bash</code> on the first line of a cell, IPython Notebook will automatically take the remainder of the cell and execute it as a [Bash](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) script on the machine where the server is running. In case you come from a Windows background or are a Mac user who hasn't yet encountered Bash, it's the name of the default shell on most Linux systems, including the virtual machine that runs the IPython Notebook server.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Vagrant virtual machine maps the top level directory of your GitHub checkout (the directory containing _README.md_) on your host machine to its _/home/vagrant/share_ folder and automatically synchronizes files between the guest and host environments as an incredible convenience to you. This mapping and synchronization enables IPython Notebooks you are running on the guest machine to access files that you can conveniently manage on your host machine and vice-versa. For example, many of the scripts in IPython Notebooks may write out data files and you can easily access those data files on your host environment (should you desire to do so) without needing to connect into the virtual machine with an SSH session. On the flip side, you can provide data files to IPython Notebook, which is running on the guest machine by copying them anywhere into your top level GitHub checkout. \n",

      "In effect, the top level directory of your GitHub checkout is automatically synchronized between the guest and host environments so that you have access to everything that is happening and can manage your source code, modified notebooks, and everything else all from your host machine. See _vagrant/Vagrantfile_ for more details on how synchronized folders can be configured.\n",
      "\n",

Keep in mind that the code that you execute in this cell writes data to the guest (virtual machine) environment, and it's Vagrant that automatically synchronizes it back to your guest environment.
