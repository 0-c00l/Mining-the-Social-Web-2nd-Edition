      "\n",
      "Welcome to the source code repository for [_Mining the Social Web (2nd Edition)_](http://bit.ly/135dHfs)! This IPython Notebook provides an interactive way to follow along with and explore the numbered examples from the book, and the intent behind this notebook is to reinforce the concepts from the sample code in a fun, convenient, and effective way.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are reading this page, it probably means that you've been able to either successfully download the virtual machine and point your browser to this IPython Notebook, or it means that you've been able to download the source code and start IPython Notebook on your own without the virtual machine. In either case, let me be the first to offer my congratulations and let you know that I am excited that you've chosen to take an interest in _Mining the Social Web_. (In the somewhat unlikely event that you've somehow stumbled across this notebook outside of its context on GitHub, [you can find the full source code repository here](http://bit.ly/16kGNyb).)\n",
      "\n",
      "The default expectation is that you as a consumer of _Mining the Social Web_ and its source code will take advantage of the virtual machine experience (powered by Vagrant) that's provided with this book. See the README.md file in the parent directory for a brief overview on just how quick and easy Vagrant makes it to get started and so that you can avoid dealing with myriad system administration complexities that you would otherwise be liable for figuring out to configure your development environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The directory that contains this file also contains all of the IPython Notebooks for _Mining the Social Web_, so in order to explore the source code for any given chapter, just open the corresponding notebook from http://localhost:8888. If you haven't previously encountered IPython Notebook, you can learn more about it at http://ipython.org/notebook.html. The source code for _Mining the Social Web_ book uses IPython Notebook almost exclusively to present the source code as a means of streamlining and enhancing the learning experience, so it is highly recommended that you take a few minutes to learn more about how it works and why it's such an excellent learning (and development) platform.\n",

For example, the notebook that illustrates working with LinkedIn data references a CSV file that you export from LinkedIn and analyze with IPython Notebook. In order to get files onto the virtual machine so that the notebook can reference them, just copy the file you'd like to share into the _vagrant/share_ folder and it'll be available to you to access at _/home/vagrant/share_ as illustrated in the following example. (The configuration for managing this shared folder can be seen in _vagrant/Vagrantfile_.)"
