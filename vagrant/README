This directory contains the files for creating a Virtualbox that's preloaded with all of the Python dependencies and source code for Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition by using Vagrant. If you are a reader of Mining the Social Web or a consumer of its source code, you might prefer to just download the pre-build Virtualbox image instead of using Vagrant to bootstrap your own, but if you are interested in learning more about Vagrant to do these kinds of things, see <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/>. If you are programmer comfortable working in a Terminal and with Python tools, you might simply prefer to checkout the source code and configure your own working environment. (If you do, the use of a tool like virtualenv is highly recommended.)
