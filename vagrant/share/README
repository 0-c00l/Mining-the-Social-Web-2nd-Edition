If you are opting-in to the virtual machine experience, this is a folder that's configured in your Vagrantfile and allows you to share files through to your Vagrant box at the path '/home/vagrant/share'. This configuration provides the ability to access files on your host machine through the IPython Notebook that's running remotely on the virtual machine without needing to manually copy the files with a utility like SSH, which may be cumbersome for some users who aren't familiar with command line tools. See the example in the 'Welcome' notebook for more details on how to access the files that you can add to this folder.
