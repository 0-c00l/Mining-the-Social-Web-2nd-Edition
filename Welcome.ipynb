      "Welcome to the source code repository for _Mining the Social Web (2nd Edition)_! This IPython Notebook provides an interactive way to follow along with and explore the numbered examples from _Mining the Social Web_, 2nd Edition. The intent behind this notebook is to reinforce the concepts from the sample code in a fun, convenient, and effective way. This notebook assumes that you are reading along with the book and have the context of the discussion as you work through these exercises.\n",

      "If you are reading this page, it means that you've been able to either successfully download the virtual machine and point your browser to this IPython Notebook, or it means that you've been able to download the source code and start IPython Notebook on your own without the virtual machine. In either case, let me be the first to offer my congratulations and let you know that I am excited that you've chosen to take an interest in _Mining the Social Web_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so you're aware, even if you are an accomplished developer, you may still find it worthwhile to use the turn-key virtual machine that's been provided since it is tested and comes pre-loaded with all of the correct dependencies for following along with the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "This directory contains all of the IPython Notebooks for _Mining the Social Web_ organized by chapter, so in order to explore the source code for any given chapter, just navigate to the directory corresponding to the chapter that you are interested in and run the following command to launch a server running the notebook for that particular chapter:\n",
      "\n",
      "<code>ipython notebook --ip='0.0.0.0'</code>\n",
      "\n",
      "This command will start an IPython Notebook server on the virtual machine that you can access by pointing your everyday web browser to the port it provides in its standard output message as it starts up.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven't already used IPython Notebook, you should consider spending a few minutes tinkering around in it: http://ipython.org/notebook.html\n",
